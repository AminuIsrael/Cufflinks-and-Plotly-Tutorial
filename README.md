### Cufflinks-and-Plotly-Tutorial
Plotly is a Python library which is used to design graphs, especially interactive graphs. It can plot various graphs and charts like histogram, bar plot, boxplot, spread plot and many more. It is mainly used in data analysis as well as financial analysis. Plotly is an interactive visualization library and you can use it to blow your audience away.
One of the beautiful things about Plotly and Cufflinks is that:
It supports hosting services, which means anyone around the world can view your plots, It also help in data presentation and graphical analysis for business startups whose budget is so little when purchasing other Data hosting services.
Plotly is built on top of d3.js and is specifically a charting library which can be used directly with Pandas Dataframes, thanks to another library named Cufflinks.
Cufflinks connects Plotly with pandas to create graphs and charts of Dataframes directly. 
The Plotly Python package is an open-source library built on plotly.jswhich in turn is built on d3.js. Weâ€™ll be using a wrapper on plotly called Cufflinks designed to work with Pandas Dataframes. So, our entire stack is cufflinks > plotly > plotly.js > d3.js which means we get the efficiency of coding in Python with the incredible interactive graphics capabilities.
Plotly itself is a graphics company with several products and open-source tools. The Python library is free to use, and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode plus up to 25 charts in online mode to share with the world.
